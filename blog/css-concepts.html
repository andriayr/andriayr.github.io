<h2>Jan 16, 2016</h2>

<p> Hi everyone, this marks my 3rd week in DBC, and I've surely learned a lot. Up to this point, I've learned about the command line, Git, and Github, HTML, and now CSS. To end the week, I would like to address some important concepts about CSS that you will find useful as you begin learning to code. Here are a few...</p>

<p class="first">What is the difference between margin, border, and padding? </p>

      <p> You will notice that at the center of it all is the content, this is where you place all of your information including all of yours tags, classes, ID's, etc. Next you will find the padding.Your padding is used to control how far away the content is away from the border. Next, you will see the border which separates the padding from the margin. Lastly, on the outside of the boder, you will find the margin. The margin properties set the size of the white space that is found outside of the border.

  <p class="first"> What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids? </p>


    <p>Before I discuss best practices for IDs vs Classes, I believe it is important to understand what each do when using HTML and CSS. The basic concept is simple, using IDs and Classes give the designer the ability target specific components of your code so you can manipulate it uniquely from the other elements. What does that mean exactly you may ask... For example if you have multiple <ordered list> tags, but you only want the first ordered list tag to have a colored background you can use an ID or Class to ensure that that particular ordered list has a colored background. Now that we have discussed their function, lets discuss best practices. </p>
      <p>When using IDs a designer must understand that IDs are unique and can only be used 1x on your page per element.If you attempt to use it multiple times throughout your page, your code will not pass Validation. And validation is essential, so knowing that should keep us all in line when it comes to following best practices. So now that we know IDs are unique, you may expect that Classes are NOT unique. Classes can be used multiple times. So if you have any styling that needs to be applied to a number of objects, you would use a class. You can use the same class on more than one element, and/or you can use multiple classes on the same element. So a simple way to remember this is to know that if you plan on reusing the information over and over, use classes, but if it is unique then it should be kept in an ID. </p>


    <p class="first">What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning? </p>
    <p>Static is the default positioning for every page element.This means that the elements on the page will flow onto the page as it normally would.  </p>
    <p>Relative means that the position is relative to itself. From what I am reading, and think I understand about relative positioning is that if you set a position to relative with no other attributes it will be exactly the same as if you left it static. But if you begin adding attributes then it will begin to shift its position as told by the attribute to where it would normally be. </p>
      <p>Absolute position allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it to go. This is where the top,left, bottom, right attributes. </p>
      <p>Fixed positioning is position relative to the browser window, so a fixed position element will stay right where it is when you begin scrolling.</p>

    <p class="first"> What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block? </p>
     <div> <img src="../imgs/css-display-block-vs-inline-block.png" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>

    <p> Initially, I had a difficult time trying to understand the difference between inline and inline-block. I hope I can explain this to you all in a way that makes sense. You must start by understanding the lay out of a web page. Each element is broken up into rectangular boxes.The display value that you input will determine how that box will behave. According to CSS-Tricks, the default value for all elements is inline, and the default styles that the browser applies to all sites resets most of the elements in blocks.</p>
    <p> So as previously stated, inline is the default value for elements.Inline elements will not accept height or width values, but they will accept margin and padding. What this means in that when an inline value is set, and margin and padding have been added, it will only push the other surrounding objects away and the element will remain inline. </p>

    <p> Inline-block has some similarities to inline. The only difference is that you are able to add a width and height value that will be applied. </p>
