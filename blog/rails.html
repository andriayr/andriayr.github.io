<h1>Rails? What's That?</h1>

<h3>Feb 18, 2016</h3>



      <p> Rails is an open source web application development framework written in the Ruby language under the MIT license. The purpose of Rails is to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs in order to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.In fact, you could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework.  Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun. </p>

<p>Rails is considered an "opinionated software" because it makes the assumption that there is the "best" way to do something, and it's designed to encourage that we do things in that particular way. In some cases, it even discourages alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll notice that your productivity will improve, but if you insist on bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, it will be difficult to learn Ruby, but overtime, if you just follow the Ruby rules, you will be just fine. </p>

<h2>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable and tends to be much easier to debug.</li>

<li>Convention Over Configuration: "Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions." What does this mean? Well it means that your application code and your running database already contains everything that Rails needs to know!</li>
</ol>
