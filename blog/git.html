  <h1> To GIT or Not To GIT? That Is The Question!  </center></h1>

  <h1> What are the benefits of version control?</h1>

  <h1>Jan 2, 2016</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      This is my first week of DBC, and I am learning a great deal. One of the most important and useful tools I became aquainted with was version control software. What does it do, you may ask? Well simply put, it keeps track of the changes that you make to a file. I know I am oversimpliyfing what it does, because it does a host of other things, but this is what I have found to be the most useful feature (for myself- a very, very new coder). </p>

      <p>
        Skill Crush had a straight forward explanation of version control that I thought was super useful, and recommend you all check it out. Below you will find my summary of my two favorite benefits of version control (thus far) </p>

      <p>1. Version control keeps track of your files, and logs all of the changes. This is awesome because if you accidently mess something up, you can always go back to your previous code to the point before you broke your code. This is the perfect safeguard for any and all coders.</p>

      <p>2. It lets you collaborate with others. Version control lets you work on the same file at the same time, without screwing up your code. There's a feature called merge, that takes commits by two or more people and it merges the commits, and makes a new document that reflects the outcome of your collaboration. </p>

  <h1> How does git help you keep track of changes? </h1>


    <p>
        So far in my learning process there are a few key commands that have helped me understand how git helps me track files. To begin, the following commands should be embedded in your memory: </p>
        <p>
        1. Make a new file: touch newfile.txt </p>

        <p> 2. Add it: git add newfile.txt </p>

        <p> 3. Make an initial commit: git commit -m "Initial commit" </p>

        <p> 4. See what you have done: git log </p>

        <p> 5. Check to see what has changed: git diff </p>

        <p> Its a good idea to commit early, and commit often. Commit is the equivalent of "save". If your commits are small, it will become much easier to go back and review what you have done, and allow you to undo the damage you may have caused.  So to answer the question, how does git help you track changes, is by letting you commit early and often, and by letting you track all of the changes you made to you program.
    </p>

    <h1> Why use GitHub to store your code? </h1>
    <p>
        A few great reasons to use Github to store your code include: </p>

        <p>1. Version Control- Everything you have on Github is stored on Git. And Version control is what allows you to make mistakes in your code without compromising the final product. </p>

        <p>2. Keeps your code in a remote location: If you happen to be traveling or working on multiple computers, GitHub lets you access the codes you have been working on from anywhere.</p>

        <p> 3. Allows for Collaboration: Once you have pushed your code onto Github, you can invite others to work on your code, ask for help to debug or even ask for help if you get stuck. </p>
