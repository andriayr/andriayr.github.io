<p> Hi everyone, this marks my 4th week in DBC, and this week we started working on Ruby. There are many concepts that I feel that I grasped, and others where I still need work...but today I am going to share some of my new-found Ruby knowledge.</p>

<h2>Arrays; what are they? and how do you create them? </h2>
<div><img src="../imgs/array_indexing.png" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>


      <p> What are arrays:
        Ruby arrays can be understood as a list. These lists happen to be ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index. The image above illustrates an array.

<p>Array indexing starts at 0. A negative index is hoisted to the end of the array --- that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on, and so forth. You should be able to identify an array because arrays can always be found between [].

Creating Arrays:
array1=[4,5,6,7,8]
array2=["mom","dad", "brother", "sister"]

Above you can see I created two arrays. The first array is named 'array1' and consists of numbers, and the second array 'array2' consists of a string of objects. You can create an array that holds String, Integer, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other Array objects.  Follow those steps and you will be perfectly fine!

  <h2> Hashes; what are they? and how do you create them? </h2>


    <p>Before I discuss best practices for IDs vs Classes, I believe it is important to understand what each do when using HTML and CSS. The basic concept is simple, using IDs and Classes give the designer the ability target specific components of your code so you can manipulate it uniquely from the other elements. What does that mean exactly you may ask... For example if you have multiple <ordered list> tags, but you only want the first ordered list tag to have a colored background you can use an ID or Class to ensure that that particular ordered list has a colored background. Now that we have discussed their function, lets discuss best practices. </p>
      <p>When using IDs a designer must understand that IDs are unique and can only be used 1x on your page per element.If you attempt to use it multiple times throughout your page, your code will not pass Validation. And validation is essential, so knowing that should keep us all in line when it comes to following best practices. So now that we know IDs are unique, you may expect that Classes are NOT unique. Classes can be used multiple times. So if you have any styling that needs to be applied to a number of objects, you would use a class. You can use the same class on more than one element, and/or you can use multiple classes on the same element. So a simple way to remember this is to know that if you plan on reusing the information over and over, use classes, but if it is unique then it should be kept in an ID. </p>


    <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning? </h2>
    <p>Static is the default positioning for every page element.This means that the elements on the page will flow onto the page as it normally would.  </p>
    <p>Relative means that the position is relative to itself. From what I am reading, and think I understand about relative positioning is that if you set a position to relative with no other attributes it will be exactly the same as if you left it static. But if you begin adding attributes then it will begin to shift its position as told by the attribute to where it would normally be. </p>
      <p>Absolute position allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it to go. This is where the top,left, bottom, right attributes. </p>
      <p>Fixed positioning is position relative to the browser window, so a fixed position element will stay right where it is when you begin scrolling.</p>

    <h2> What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block? </h2>
     <div> <img src="../imgs/css-display-block-vs-inline-block.png" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>

    <p> Initially, I had a difficult time trying to understand the difference between inline and inline-block. I hope I can explain this to you all in a way that makes sense. You must start by understanding the lay out of a web page. Each element is broken up into rectangular boxes.The display value that you input will determine how that box will behave. According to CSS-Tricks, the default value for all elements is inline, and the default styles that the browser applies to all sites resets most of the elements in blocks.</p>
    <p> So as previously stated, inline is the default value for elements.Inline elements will not accept height or width values, but they will accept margin and padding. What this means in that when an inline value is set, and margin and padding have been added, it will only push the other surrounding objects away and the element will remain inline. </p>

    <p> Inline-block has some similarities to inline. The only difference is that you are able to add a width and height value that will be applied. </p>
