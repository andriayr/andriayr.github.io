<h2>Jan 22, 2016</h2>

<p> Hi everyone, this marks my 4th week in DBC, and this week we started working on Ruby. There are many concepts that I feel that I grasped, and others where I still need work...but today I am going to share some of my new-found Ruby knowledge.</p>

<p class="first">Arrays </p>
<div><img src="../imgs/array_indexing.png" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>


      <p class="bigger"> What are arrays:</p>
      <p>Ruby arrays can be understood as a list. These lists happen to be ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index. The image to the right illustrates an array.</p>

<p>Array indexing starts at 0. A negative index is hoisted to the end of the array --- that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on, and so forth. You should be able to identify an array because arrays can always be found between []. </p>
  <p class="bigger">Creating Arrays: </p>
   <p> array1=[4,5,6,7,8] </p>
    <p>array2=["mom","dad", "brother", "sister"] </p>
    <p>Above you can see I created two arrays. The first array is named 'array1' and consists of numbers, and the second 'array2' consists of a string of objects. You can create an array that hold strings, integers, fixnums, hashes, symbols, even other array objects. Follow those steps and you will be perfectly fine!</p>



  <p class="first"> Hashes </p>
  <div><img src="../imgs/hash-in-ruby-language1.png" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p class="bigger"> What are Hashes:</p>
  <p> Hashes are very similar to arrays. Just like arrays, hashes can be used to store information. Hashes are often called a dictionary. Unlike an array, indexing for hashes are done using object keys, not an interger index. You can think of a hash as a collection of pairs of information, and each pair is made of a name(or key) and a value. It's important to know that the name is unique. You will use the name to return the value that has been paired to it.


  <p class="bigger"> Creating Hashes:</p>

    <p>We can create hashes a few different ways. The two ways that I am familiar with are by using the hash literal notation or hash constructor notation. Creating a hash requires the use of a rocket "=>" which assigns the value on the right to the key on the left.</p>
<p> new_hash = { "one"=> 1} </p>
    <p> new_hash=Hash.new</p>


 <p class="bigger"> What's the difference between Hashes and Arrays?</p>
 <div><img src="../imgs/slide_13.jpg" alt="#" width="250" height="250"></div>

 <p> I stumbled upon a blog that I believe did a nice job of describing the differences between Hashes and Arrays. So I will use a similar example to help solidify the details... an array is a list, if you are going to the grocery store to purchase groceries, you will list each item numerically, orange juice, milk, cheese,etc. You can look and see which item comes first, second, third, etc. For example: </p>

  <p>grocery_list[0] would give you "OJ"</p>  <p>grocery_list[1] would give you "milk"</p> <p>grocery_list[2] would give you "cheese". </p>

  <p>A hash contains a collection of pairs of information, and each pair is made up of a name and a value. Sticking with our grocery store example lets create a hash shopping_hash["milk"=>"Almond Breeze"]. So if you are going to the grocery store to buy an type of item, you can specify the details of that item as the value associated with the name (or key).</p>

  <p> I hope my explanation was helpful to you all in differentiating between an array and a hash. Good luck to you in your journey to learning Ruby. </p>
