<h3>Jan 22, 2016</h3>

<p> As a Gerontologist by trade, it is incumbent that I discuss a diversity issue in tech that is often ignored, and rarely addressed. That issue is agism. There are a number of diversity issues within the tech-sphere that have garnered a great deal of attention since many tech companies shared the demographic profiles of their employees. Presently a microscope is placed on areas such as Silicon Valley demanding that there be more representation of women and people of color. As a women of color, I stand with those demanding such changes. However, as a member of two marginalized groups, I refuse to participate in the oppression of others. Therefore, this small blog will represent a (very) brief overview about agism in this industry. To begin, its important to know the facts. 
</p>

<p>FACT: In our emerging, “aging” society, those over 60 will outnumber those under 15. </p>
<p>FACT: By the time we reach 2030, 1 in five adults will be 65+. </p>
<p>FACT: The senior population in CA is 11% of the total, at approximately 4.5 million seniors. That number will double in the next 30 years.</p> 
<p>Now that I’ve painted a slight picture on aging trends, let’s discuss some issues in tech that relate to aging. According to an article published by the New Republic in 2014, “Silicon Valley has become one of the most ageist places in America.” Tech executives have openly revealed their thoughts about older adults, with little to no consequence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated “Young people are just smarter” and ServiceNow, an IT service company in Santa Clara has showcased their position on hiring older people, by stating “We Want People Who Have Their Best Work Ahead of Them, Not Behind Them.” This statement is printed clearly on their “careers” page. Now it’s not fair to say that all tech companies take on this position, but what we have seen when it comes to the hiring practices of many, is that they are not doing anything to remedy this matter. </p>
<p>The data that I provided above was to help draw a connection as to why this is an actual issue. People are getting older. Older people will outnumber younger people. Cost of living is rising significantly, health care costs are rising, and although we are living longer, we are not healthier. If we forcefully push out older people from the tech industry this will not only compromise an entire demographic of people from living sustainable lives, (all due to a biological phenomenon in which we have absolutely no control over), but it will also hinder the growth of the economy. </p>
<p>Let me pause momentarily, and share another fact… <b>WE ARE ALL AGING!</b></p>
<p>Now to some this may not seem like a significant issue. Much like other types of discrimination, if its not directly related to us, we dismiss it, or assume it doesn't actually exist. Yet the fact remains that this is a real issue, and is impacting the lives of real people. Many of those pursuing careers in tech are young (including myself), with budding careers ahead of us. However, just because this isn’t directly targeting us, does not mean we don’t have a social responsibility. It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not stand aside and allow for discriminatory practices to take place anywhere, to anyone, at anytime. If we let this issue remain rampant, one day, when we get older, we may fall victim to agism. </p>

  <p>Personal Comment & Potential Solutions </p>

    <p>I am often surprised that we live in such a sophisticated society, but we require the need for diversity initiatives in this country to ensure playing fields are leveled. In 2016 we are still so far behind.  It’s a sad reality that the work place is not balanced or equal. It’s even sadder because the solution is simple… hire people that have what it takes to get the job done despite their age, their race, their sex, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Why do organizations have to make declarations as to what year they will begin hiring more “older adults” or “women” or “people of color?” Why is it still not common place to put forth nondiscriminatory practices ? That should be the foundation of any organization. What sense does it make to create products that are utilized by different types people, but are created by a homogenous group? It makes no sense at all. Below are my thoughts on ways to remedy this obvious, (yet not so obvious to everyone) problem:
</p>
<p>Targeted hiring-purposefully identify and recruit people that fall under a category that is not represented in your organization. Be careful not to make this person the token, hiring 1 does not solve the problem. </p>
  <p>Unconscious bias training- have your hiring team, management team, and executive team participate in unconscious bias training. This will educate your team on their unconscious biases, therefore making them aware of their behavior and how they may be creating a tense, uncomfortable, or unsafe work space. </p>
  <p>Microaggression training - This will teach your team how to recognize microagressions and how to avoid them. Microagressions are often the cause of uncomfortable work dynamics. </p>
  <p> Provide skill training- I am a firm believer that you should hire character, and train skills. Hire people that you believe have the tenacity and desire to learn, a passion to be better, and train them to succeed. Some older adults may not have all the skills needed to be a developer, but they have other valuable skills that can enhance the work place.  </p>
