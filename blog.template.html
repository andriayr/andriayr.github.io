<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I had the privillege of working with an empathetic partner, so the process of wireframing  was a positive one. My partner was used to driving and I was used to navigating, so we did our best to switch roles. He created the wireframe based on our conversation on what we thought it should look like, so we both could add input for things we thought should or should not be included.  Creating the HTML file also seemed pretty straight to the point. This activity was a lot less scary than I intitially anticipated, which I am really happy about.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

When the topic of wireframing came up, I merely thought it was just another step in the process. Something you have to do, just because. But now that I have had a few opportunities to create wireframes myself, I see the value of this step in the process. It paints a clear picture that is essential in maintaining cohesion in the creating process. So yes, I do find wireframing to be helpful in my development process.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that our wireframe should include a photo, meta tags, and content. We kept it pretty general due to the instructions that were outlined, but ultimately, we understand that it is important to have a wireframe that shows the user friendly nature of our site.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

For our wireframe we included meta tags. And although it was discussed in some of the videos we have watched in DBC, I had not ever used a meta tag before. That was the only new semantic element that I learned during this pairing assignment. -->
