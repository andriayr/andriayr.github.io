What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

This was a great exercise. It really allowed me to manipulate the values to impact what my margins did. I learned that it is difficult to gauge how much a margin will move just by inputting numbers, and I imagine that after doing this for an extended period of it will get easier to do.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning is tricky. Much like margins/padding/borders your value makes the biggest difference.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? The easiest part of my design was inputting the text, footer, img, and even aside.

What was most difficult? I found the positioning to be the most difficult part of this assignment.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? I learned how to use CSS to make your site look good in a very basic way. Gradually I began to understand how to apply the pseduo codes and how they operate. I also learned that creating web pages can be a very cumbersome task. But once you see the final product, you have something you can feel good about.
